  <p>
    Hey everyone — Icey here. Today we're shipping <strong>Astroblox Update 0.1</strong>, the first
    official changelog drop since we started building in public. It's a small number but a big
    milestone — this is where things start to feel real.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here's everything that landed in this update.
  </p>

  <h2>🚀 Landing Page Refresh</h2>

  <p>
    The landing page got a full visual overhaul. We rebuilt it from scratch with a new cinematic
    hero section, tighter spacing, and a much cleaner first impression. The old version felt
    rushed — this one actually represents what Astroblox is becoming.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>New hero with animated meteor strike sequence</li>
    <li>Refreshed typography and color system</li>
    <li>Improved mobile layout across all breakpoints</li>
    <li>Faster load — cut unnecessary assets</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🛠 Deployment Fixes</h2>

  <p>
    We've been dealing with some flaky deployments over the past few weeks — builds succeeding
    locally but failing in CI, environment variables not propagating correctly, and a couple of
    routing issues on the production edge. All of that is fixed in 0.1.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Fixed env variable injection in production builds</li>
    <li>Resolved client-side routing 404s on direct URL access</li>
    <li>Stabilised the CI pipeline — green builds are green now</li>
    <li>Added proper build caching to cut deploy times by ~40%</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📝 The Blog is Live</h2>

  <p>
    You're reading it. The Astroblox Blog is now a proper part of the product — built with Vue 3,
    Tailwind, and a custom composable that reads posts directly from <code>.html</code> files.
    No CMS overhead, no third-party dependencies. Just files.
  </p>

  <p>
    Posts are filtered automatically for content policy, support per-category theming, and the
    whole thing is fast. We'll be posting here regularly — engineering deep-dives, feature
    previews, community highlights, and updates like this one.
  </p>

  <h2>🔗 GitHub — Open Source Commitment</h2>

  <p>
    We've imported and organised our repositories under
    <a href="https://github.com/BloxGlobe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">github.com/BloxGlobe</a>.
    We're currently sitting at 11 repos and growing. Parts of the Astroblox platform will be
    open-sourced as we stabilise APIs and internal tooling — watch that org page.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you want to contribute, report a bug, or just poke around the code — that's the place.
    Star a repo if something looks interesting.
  </p>

  <h2>✨ Other Changes</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Navbar reworked — logo left, search center, menu dropdown right</li>
    <li>Footer redesigned with newsletter signup and social links</li>
    <li>Post cards rebuilt with per-category gradients and hover animations</li>
    <li>Search now filters across title, excerpt, author, and category</li>
    <li>Profanity filter active across all user-facing content</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What's Next</h2>

  <p>
    Update 0.2 is already in progress. On the roadmap: user accounts, post comments, a proper
    search index, and the first public API endpoints. We're building fast but not cutting corners —
    every update will have a post like this one so you always know what changed and why.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thanks for being here early. It genuinely means a lot. 💝
  </p>
